# Interaction Handler

### The problem

In a highly interactive application, there soon becomes many interaction types defined. Some of these interactions are instantaneous -- such as a simple button press -- but some of which are persistent until an action ends it -- such as drawing or editing something. Interactions can further have complex processes on starting/ending (such as saving the edits when finished). This is complicated by the fact that the user may try to start another interaction while one is currently ongoing. The current interaction must be ended, but is it ended gracefully or interrupted? Does it first have a prompt asking the user if they're sure to cancel said interaction? Suddenly, you're writing boilerplate for making sure every interaction interrupts the other correctly and event listeners start to become convoluted.

### The idea

The current active interaction becomes a state, which `InteractionHandler` manages. Aside from ability to handle listeners on an OpenLayers map instance (optional), it does not actually process the interactions themselves, it only manages them. However all interactions must be started and ended through the handler.

### Interaction lifecycle

At the simplest, an interaction starts and eventually ends. The interaction may be instantaneous, in which it runs a process and ends immediately when said process is finished. Or an interaction may be persistent and is active until another action ends it.

Only one interaction may be active at one time. When another interaction attempts to start while an interaction is currently active, it sends an interrupt request. The currently active interaction then begins the interrupt process by canceling the interaction.

There are more complicated routes as we get into ending versus canceling, restarting interactions, interruption confirmation, and cancel starts. These will be covered in more depth in the later sections.

### Defining an interaction

Interactions are defined primarily through callbacks. For greater detail see the [API](API.md), but the below gives a rough outline on defining an interaction.

##### `InteractionHandler.prototype.addInteraction(name, interaction)`

| Param | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name | Unique name for this interaction. |
| interaction | Interaction parameters. |
| interaction.start | Hook on starting interaction. |
| interaction.end | Hook on ending the interaction. |
| [interaction.restart] | Optional hook on restarting the interaction (that is, interaction start was called when it was already active). |
| [interaction.cancelStart] | Optional hook called when canceling start interaction (e.g. when start was attempted but blocked). |
| [interaction.clear] | Optional hook called on clearing an interaction, which is done when interaction is ended. Generally unnecessary but may have special use cases. |
| [interaction.checkInterrupt] | Optional interrupt checking function. If supplied, hook called to confirm interruption, when this interruption is active and another attempts to interrupt it. |
| [interaction.map] | Optional object of listener callbacks on the `olMap` with key being the event name and value being value being callback on that event. Map event listening must first be enabled via [addMapListener](#InteractionHandler+addMapListener)(). |
| interaction.olInteraction | Optional OpenLayers map interaction to bind with this interaction. |
| [interaction.saveOnInterrupt] | Special case, if true, to save changes even if interrupted. That is, treat any interruption as a normal end interaction. |

##### Flowchart on starting and interaction

How the above hooks are called/used when starting a new interaction is shown below.

### Simple use case

In this example, we're want to add measurement tools for both distance and area. For these, we will use OpenLayers' built in draw interaction handler, but then wrap everything under the interaction handler. The UI elements we'll assume are defined somewhere in the webpage as follows, each of which will start a unique interaction type (plus one button to cancel).

```html
<button class="ui-measure" geom="line" for="measure-line">Measure Distance</button>
<button class="ui-measure" geom="poly" for="measure-poly">Measure Area</button>
<button class="ui-measure-cancel">Cancel</button>
```

First let's defined the callbacks for the start/end hooks which apply and remove these OpenLayers interactions to the map, and if ending, alert the length/area measurement.

```javascript
var olInteraction;  // store the active OpenLayer interaction here so we can remove it

function startMeasure(evt) {
    var geomType = evt ? evt.currentTarget.getAttribute("geom") : null;
    if(geomType === "line") {
        geomType = "LineString";
    } else if(geomType === "poly") {
        geomType = "Polygon";
    } else {
        // if no recognized geometry type, end interaction
        interactionHandler.endInteraction(null, true);
        return;
    }
    olInteraction = new ol.interaction.Draw({
        source: measureLayerSource, 
        type: geomType, 
        style: this.measureStyle
    });
    // on draw end of the OpenLayers interaction, end the interaction
    olInteraction.on("drawend", function(evt) {
        interactionHandler.endInteraction(evt, false);
    });
    olMap.addInteraction(olInteraction);
}

// evt will be a special OpenLayers event, which has the feature property
function endMeasure(evt, cancel) {
    if(olInteraction) {
        olMap.removeInteraction(olInteraction);
        olInteraction = null;
    }
    if(!cancel && evt && evt.feature) {
        var geom = evt.feature.getGeometry();
        if(geom.getType() === "LineString") {
            alert(ol.sphere.getLength(geom));
        } else {
            alert(ol.sphere.getArea(geom));
        }
    }
}
```

While we can share the hooks as they're written generically, the interactions themselves (for line and polygon measurements) are unique so they are added separately to the interaction handler with unique names.

```javascript
var interactionHandler = new InteractionHandler();

interactionHandler.addInteraction(
    "measure-line", 
    {
        start: startMeasure, 
        end: endMeasure, 
        saveOnInterrupt: false
    }
);
interactionHandler.addInteraction(
    "measure-poly", 
    {
        start: startMeasure, 
        end: endMeasure, 
        saveOnInterrupt: false
    }
);
```

Going back to the HTML buttons, we will bind the `click` listeners via [`bindUiElements(elems, options)`](API.md#InteractionHandler+bindUiElements). The name of the interaction they start are given by the attribute, which we pull on clicking with the `value` callback to get the interaction name. The cancel button, meanwhile, is set to only interrupt any active events, without starting any interaction of its own.

```javascript
interactionHandler.bindUiElements(
    document.querySelectorAll(".ui-measure"), 
    {
        event: 'click', 
        value: function() {
            return this.getAttribute("for");
        }
    }
);
interactionHandler.bindUiElements(
    document.querySelector(".ui-measure-cancel"), 
    {interruptOnly: true}
);
```

Note you do not necessarily have to use [`bindUiElements()`](API.md#InteractionHandler+bindUiElements), you can manually bind events as you like to [`startInteraction()`](API.md#InteractionHandler+startInteraction) and [`endInteraction()`](API.md#InteractionHandler+endInteraction). This just makes a quick shortcut.

##### Restarting interactions and canceling on reclick

If clicking, say, the measure line button to activate it, then clicking it again, we actually restarted the interaction. This actually causes `startMeasure` to be called twice, without calling `endMeasure`, which is erroneous and will double up adding `ol.interaction.Draw` to the map.

To counter this, you may add code to enable and disable the buttons. But we may also want to add a programmatic check. In the simplest case, we can add a restart callback that returns `false`, thus halting retriggering the start interaction callback while still keeping the interaction active.

```javascript
// and same with 'measure-poly'
interactionHandler.addInteraction(
    "measure-line", 
    {
        start: startMeasure, 
        end: endMeasure, 
        restart: function() { return false; }, 
        checkInterrupt: confirmInterrupt, 
        saveOnInterrupt: false
    }
);
```

Alternatively, you may want it such that clicking on the button when it's already active actually ends it (via interruption). We can do this by setting the generic interaction start hook.

```javascript
interactionHandler.onInteractionStart = function(evt, name) {
    if(this.activeInteraction === name) {
        this.interrupt();  // call interruption
        return false;      // return false to not continue starting this interaction
    }
};
```

##### Prompt to confirm interruption

As written above, interrupting/canceling the measure interaction will simply end the interaction without computing the distance or area measured. Perhaps we want to have the user prompted whether to confirm cancellation when such an event occurs. If so, in the interaction options, we can define a callback for `checkInterrupt`.

```javascript
// will be passed two callbacks to choose how to continue
function confirmInterrupt(interrupt, cancel) {
    var modal = document.querySelector("#modal");
    modal.innerHTML = (
        "<p>Cancel measurement?</p>" + 
        "<button id='modal-cancel'>No, continue measuring</button>" + 
        "<button id='modal-confirm'>Yes, stop measuring</button>"
    );
    modal.querySelector("#modal-confirm").addEventListener('click', function() {
        interrupt();
        modal.innerHTML = "";
        modal.style.display = "none";
    });
    modal.querySelector("#modal-cancel").addEventListener('click', function() {
        cancel();
        modal.innerHTML = "";
        modal.style.display = "none";
    });
    modal.style.display = "block";
}

// and same with 'measure-poly'
interactionHandler.addInteraction(
    "measure-line", 
    {
        start: startMeasure, 
        end: endMeasure, 
        restart: function() { return false; }, 
        checkInterrupt: confirmInterrupt, 
        saveOnInterrupt: false
    }
);
```

### More notes

##### End interaction vs. interrupt

Ending an interaction simply ends the interaction. Interrupting the interaction attempts to end the interaction but may be rejected depending on whether a `checkInterrupt` callback exists for the interaction and is therein canceled. However, if confirmed, interrupt will eventually route to `endInteraction()`. Additionally, the default state of an `endInteraction()` call is that it is not a 'cancel' event. An interaction ended through `interrupt()` sets the `cancel` parameter to `true`.

##### Default listeners

Default listeners that are always triggered on starting or ending an interaction can be applied through `onInteractionStart()` and `onInteractionEnd()`. 

The default start interaction event listener is called immediately before starting the interaction itself (that is, before the interaction specific `interactionStart` callback) and may return `false` to cancel the interaction start. The default end interaction event listener is called after ending the interaction.

Additionally, there you may add default event listeners to clear and update events with `onClear()` and `onUpdate()`. 

The *on-clear* listener if called before the default end interaction listener, but may be suppressed with `suppressClear` parameter in `endInteraction()` is `true`. 

The *on-update* listener is called last and is unique in that it gets passed the ended interaction name-key and, if it exists, any object returned by the interaction specific `interactionEnd` callback, or the exception if said callback errored.

##### Error handling

All user supplied callbacks are wrapped in a try-catch block within the `interactionStart()` and `interactionEnd()` methods. Generally speaking, if an exception occurs during `interactionStart()`, the interaction is assumed to have failed to start and still inactive. If an exception occurs during `interactionEnd()`, the process continues until it has cleared the interaction and is assumed inactive. Obviously though, do not assume exceptions will be handled cleanly and rely solely on this.

##### OpenLayers map listeners

For special map events that are handled internally in OpenLayers, like zoom or view changes, we can use the OpenLayers map supplied in the constructor and some special hooks and functions to handle these. 

Map listening callback are optionally provided with each interaction via the `interaction.map` parameter. The map listener for each interaction will only work when said interaction is active. However, listeners are not applied to the map itself, and thus cannot be activated, until `addMapListener()` is called for the events specified. It is always safe to call `addMapListener()` again as it overwrites instead of adds. `addMapListener()` does not need to be called again for the same event type after adding a new interaction with map listeners, provided it was already applied. 

```javascript
var interactionHandler = new InteractionHandler(olMap);

interactionHandler.addInteraction(
    'map-move-listening', 
    {
        start: function(evt) { /* nothing of interest */ }, 
        end: function(evt, cancel) { /* nothing of interest */ }
        map: {
            movestart: function(evt) {
                console.log("Map moving in progress.");
            }, 
            moveend: function(evt) {
                console.log("Map view changed.");
            }
        }
    }
);

// need to activate the map listeners on the events we are using
interactionHandler.addEventListener('movestart');
interactionHandler.addEventListener('moveend');

interactionHandler.startInteraction('map-move-listening');
/* 
 * during here, the console log statements will be happening during map moves
 */
interactionHandler.endInteraction()

```

Map listeners can also be temporarily disabled and enabled via `disableMapInteraction()` and `enableMapInteraction()` without ending or otherwise affecting the currently active interaction.

The OpenLayers map being passed is optional, and the handler will not break if an OpenLayers map is not supplied. However, it will obviously break if attempting to use the map listener functionality. Additionally, the only functions called in the OpenLayers map object are `on(type, listener)` and `un(type, listener)`, so this can be replaced by anything that follows a similar interface.
